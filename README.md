### About Me  
I’m Ankur Katre, working in Data Science & AI with a focus on applied machine learning, deep learning, and automation of data workflows. I enjoy building real, deployable ML systems—models that don’t just train, but actually solve problems.

### What I Do  
- Develop ML/DL models using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn  
- Automate data pipelines for ingestion, preprocessing, and analysis  
- Work with NLP, time-series forecasting, and image processing  
- Optimize model performance through experimentation and benchmarking  
- Explore hybrid and custom architectures for anomaly detection and segmentation  

### Featured Projects  
- **LSTM Stock Price Forecasting with Automated Data Pipeline**  
  Automated pipeline + LSTM-based forecasting + sentiment integration.  
- **Email Spam Classifier using NLP**  
  Intelligent classifier outperforming traditional rule-based filters.  
- **Image Segmentation from Sparse Scribble Annotations**  
  Custom deep-learning model trained on weak labels.  
- **Hybrid Autoencoder + Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection**  
  Hybrid system improving F1-score beyond baseline models.

### Tech Stack  
**Languages:** Python, SQL, Java  
**ML/DS:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow  
**Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Excel  
**Interests:** Machine Learning, AI Systems, Finance Analytics

### Current Focus  
- Model deployment (FastAPI, lightweight APIs)  
- Reproducible ML pipelines  
- Robust deep learning architectures

### Opportunities  
Open to Data Science / Machine Learning internship roles (Remote or On-site).
